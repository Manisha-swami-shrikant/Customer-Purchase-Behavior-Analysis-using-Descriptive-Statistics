Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis using Descriptive Statistics
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchase behavior using descriptive statistical methods. By examining patterns and trends in customer spending across different categories, the analysis aims to uncover insights that can drive informed business decisions.

Objective
The primary goal of this project is to explore and summarize customer purchase data to:

Understand spending behavior across different marital status categories.
Identify key spending trends and patterns among customers.
Provide actionable insights that can enhance customer segmentation and targeting strategies.
Data
The dataset used in this analysis includes the following key attributes:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Marital Status: Category indicating the marital status of the customer.
Spending Categories: Various spending categories such as groceries, electronics, clothing, etc.
Methodology
1. Data Cleaning
Handled missing values and removed or corrected any inconsistencies in the data.
Excluded non-numeric columns where necessary for specific analyses.
2. Descriptive Statistics
Calculated key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for spending categories.
Analyzed spending behavior across different marital status categories.
3. Data Visualization
Created visual representations of the data to highlight trends and patterns.
Used correlation matrices to understand relationships between different spending categories.
Key Findings
Average Spending by Marital Status: Calculated the average spending for each marital status category, revealing significant differences in spending patterns.
Spending Trends: Identified that certain categories, such as electronics and clothing, had higher variability in spending among different customer segments.
Correlation Analysis: Found that certain spending categories are closely related, indicating potential cross-selling opportunities.
